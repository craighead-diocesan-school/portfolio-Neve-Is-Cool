    <h2>My Project</h2>
    <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. 
      My project was THE CLAW! This included an arcade style claw which we coded to lift lollies to our customers.</p>
      <p> The process of our claw took a signifigantly long time. When we started the semester, we built incredible structures to make advertisements 
        for each of our stalls. Once we had decided to build the claw, we found a microbit lego set, which would be perfect, for what we needed. </p>
        <p> Once our claw was built, we got onto the treacherous task... Coding. Coding our claw machine, mentally destroyed all members of my team. 
          The code was incredibly difficult to figure out, with desired pieces of code taking days to download. Each time we opened our code, our claw
        never worked. Ever. It was honestly a miracle it actually worked. </p>
