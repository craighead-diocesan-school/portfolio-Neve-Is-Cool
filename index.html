    <h2>My Project</h2>

    
  
    <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. 
      My project was THE CLAW! This included an arcade style claw which we coded to lift lollies to our customers.<p/>

      <span class="tag is-danger">Choosing Digi Tech</span>
        <p>I first chose to take semester two Digi Tech, because it really sounded quite interesting. I had already taken semester one Digi Tech, so it seemed like a simple path to follow. I have always enjoyed Digi, and our project for this semester
         did seem like a good challenge. And it was.</p>
      
         <span class="tag is-danger">Ideas</span>
         <p>Once we heard that we were going to be creating games for market day, I felt a lot of excitement, realising the freedom we would have within this project.
         We had brainstormed many ideas, first as a class, then separately within groups. Our group of three had come to the conclusion
         that we wanted to construct a claw machine.</p>
      
         <span class="tag is-danger">Brainstorming</span>
         <p>As soon as this was decided, we had to figure out exactly how we would create this. In Mr. Hullen's office we found a microbit based lego building kit, which seemed like the simplest way to build of claw.
         We considered many different methods, but this one seemed the most reasonable given the time we had to construct our games.</p>
      
         <span class="tag is-danger">EPRO8 Build</span>
      <p>To create advertisements for our stalls, we created enormous structures which would sit upon a desk. These took a suprisingly long time to construct as apparently we had "done it wrong" multiple times. 
        Eventually we had finished our structures made out of EPro8 materials. These proved rather helpful in attracting customers and explaining our stall to others throughout market day.</p>

        <span class="tag is-danger">Advertising</span>
      <p>However at this stage, we had structure for advertisements, but nothing to advertise. This is when we created multiple posters and signs advertising for our stall. This included graphic design on canva, and using
          both colours and images that we as a business felt perfectly encapsulated our brand. </p>

          <span class="tag is-danger">Building our Claw</span>
      <p>Building our claw machine was a very complicated task, let alone coding it as well. Our lego set idea did prove rather affective as we had a very professional looking claw machine. Later we would discover that the building
         was the easiest part. As soon as our claw was built, we got onto the treacherous task... Coding. Coding our claw machine, mentally destroyed all members of my team. At first we I tried to download the type of code required for the claw, it took a week of it not loading before
          we decided to change computers. This immediately improved our process and it finally allowed us to begin coding. At first we got one motor working sufficiently, then the others slowly followed.</p>

          <span class="tag is-danger">Testing our Claw</span>
      <p>Testing our machine was one of the rather frustrating moments within this process. It continuously malfunctioned, did the wrong action, and our code kept deleting between each class. After a long time we discovered why we had so many malfunctions. 
        Zoe had been holding onto the microbit at the connection points, which was reason the machine kept going crazy. Each time she touched it, the machine had another spasm, which made sense why what we were trying to code was not getting through. Before the end of the lesson we 
        tried to fix this issue, but we ran out of time. At this stage I was seriously stressed out, our machine was simply not working, and we had market day tomorrow. </p>

        <span class="tag is-danger">Market Day Setup</span>
      <p>Setting up our claw for market day was stressful, Zoe believed she had fixed our problem, but I still kept my doubts. We had spread out the lollies across the table, set up our claw, and honestly just hoped for the best. Somehow this worked, as in our first test, the machine
        worked flawlessly. I stood there in shock, proud of everything my group had achieved. </p>  

        <span class="tag is-danger">Market Day</span>
      <p>Throughout market day we had many customers visit our stall, and our business was running rather successfully. However there were some unhelpful, untrue rumours flying about saying we had attempted to rig our machine to never win. Eventually, my business realised that we had simple gotten through
           all of our possible customers we would get. At this stage we still had plentiful amounts of lollies left. We made the smart business decision to sell these lollies for 50 cents each. This worked extraordinarily well, as yelling 50 cent lollies attracted many customers, even some still wanting to
            play our claw machine. </p>
 
            <span class="tag is-danger">Reflection</span>
      <p>Overall I would say our business was a huge success, with each member of my team making a decent amount of profit. I do believe if we had caught onto our connection points problem a lot sooner, this would have decreased stress and simplified our lives a lot more.
        Despite that, this experience still gave us all some good learning points that we can work on in our future endevours. I'm very proud of my team and happy with what we mananged to achieve.
