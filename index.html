      <h2>My Project</h2>

      <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day.
        My project was THE CLAW! This included an arcade style claw which we coded to lift lollies to our customers.
        <p />

        <hr>

        <span class="tag is-danger">Choosing Digi Tech</span>
      <p>I first chose to take semester two Digi Tech, because it really sounded quite interesting. I had already taken
        semester one Digi Tech, so it seemed like a simple path to follow. I have always enjoyed Digi, and our project
        for this semester
        did seem like a good challenge. And it was.</p>

      <span class="tag is-danger">Ideas</span>
      <p>Once we heard that we were going to be creating games for market day, I felt a lot of excitement, realising the
        freedom we would have within this project.
        We had brainstormed many ideas, first as a class, then separately within groups. Our group of three had come to
        the conclusion
        that we wanted to construct a claw machine.</p>

      <span class="tag is-danger">Brainstorming</span>
      <p>As soon as this was decided, we had to figure out exactly how we would create this. In Mr. Hullen's office we
        found a microbit based lego building kit, which seemed like the simplest way to build of claw.
        We considered many different methods, but this one seemed the most reasonable given the time we had to construct
        our games.</p>

      <span class="tag is-danger">EPRO8 Build</span>
      <p>To create advertisements for our stalls, we created enormous structures which would sit upon a desk. These took
        a suprisingly long time to construct as apparently we had "done it wrong" multiple times.
        Eventually we had finished our structures made out of EPro8 materials. These proved rather helpful in attracting
        customers and explaining our stall to others throughout market day.</p>

      <span class="tag is-danger">Advertising</span>
      <p>However at this stage, we had structure for advertisements, but nothing to advertise. This is when we created
        multiple posters and signs advertising for our stall. This included graphic design on canva, and using
        both colours and images that we as a business felt perfectly encapsulated our brand. </p>

      <span class="tag is-danger">Building our Claw</span>
      <p>Building our claw machine was a very complicated task, let alone coding it as well. Our lego set idea did prove
        rather affective as we had a very professional looking claw machine. Later we would discover that the building
        was the easiest part. As soon as our claw was built, we got onto the treacherous task... Coding. Coding our claw
        machine, mentally destroyed all members of my team. At first we I tried to download the type of code required
        for the claw, it took a week of it not loading before
        we decided to change computers. This immediately improved our process and it finally allowed us to begin coding.
        At first we got one motor working sufficiently, then the others slowly followed.</p>

      <span class="tag is-danger">Testing our Claw</span>
      <p>Testing our machine was one of the rather frustrating moments within this process. It continuously
        malfunctioned, did the wrong action, and our code kept deleting between each class. After a long time we
        discovered why we had so many malfunctions.
        Zoe had been holding onto the microbit at the connection points, which was reason the machine kept going crazy.
        Each time she touched it, the machine had another spasm, which made sense why what we were trying to code was
        not getting through. Before the end of the lesson we
        tried to fix this issue, but we ran out of time. At this stage I was seriously stressed out, our machine was
        simply not working, and we had market day tomorrow. </p>

      <span class="tag is-danger">Market Day Setup</span>
      <p>Setting up our claw for market day was stressful, Zoe believed she had fixed our problem, but I still kept my
        doubts. We had spread out the lollies across the table, set up our claw, and honestly just hoped for the best.
        Somehow this worked, as in our first test, the machine
        worked flawlessly. I stood there in shock, proud of everything my group had achieved. </p>

      <span class="tag is-danger">Market Day</span>
      <p>Throughout market day we had many customers visit our stall, and our business was running rather successfully.
        However there were some unhelpful, untrue rumours flying about saying we had attempted to rig our machine to
        never win. Eventually, my business realised that we had simple gotten through
        all of our possible customers we would get. At this stage we still had plentiful amounts of lollies left. We
        made the smart business decision to sell these lollies for 50 cents each. This worked extraordinarily well, as
        yelling 50 cent lollies attracted many customers, even some still wanting to
        play our claw machine. </p>

      <span class="tag is-danger">Reflection</span>
      <p>Overall I would say our business was a huge success, with each member of my team making a decent amount of
        profit. I do believe if we had caught onto our connection points problem a lot sooner, this would have decreased
        stress and simplified our lives a lot more.
        Despite that, this experience still gave us all some good learning points that we can work on in our future
        endevours. I'm very proud of my team and happy with what we mananged to achieve.

        <img src="Code for Claw.png">
        <p>Our Code took an incredibly long time and quite a lot of perserverance at determination. We came across
          numerous issues, and our code would delete before almost every digi class. We followed plently of tutorials and instructions but nothing
          seemed to work for a very long time. We couldn't even download the necessary code, even leaving it loading for days, even weeks. Still, nothing
          seemed to help and we struggled for an incredibly long time.
          The different pieces of our code took a long time to create, and even longer to understand.

      <span class="tag is-danger">Controls</span>
      <img src="Controls Code Updated.png">
      <p> This code controlled the connection to the other microbit in which customers used to play our claw machine
        game. We had the radio code from the other microbit connected to our microbit attached to the claw. We had a
        system where on the microbit, customers hit one button for left, one for right, and both for end. Our end code
        used the code we'd created for going down, grabbing, up, left and releasing.
        We found this system was simpler than a pile of ridiculously long code where we couldn't tell which piece of
        code completed which action.</p>

          <img src="Go Down Code Updated.png">
          <p>To create our code to get our claw to go down, we had to set our 360 Servo to change its angle to 200
            degrees. We found this was the desired height for the claw to reach down without whacking into the table.
            Then we paused the action, so another action could follow within the code (something we learnt after a while)
            We also used LED's on the microbit during our testing to see if the input or the output was the error within
            our system when mistakes occured.</p>

          <p>To create our code to get our claw to go up, we had to set our 360 Servo to change its angle to 135
            degrees. We found this was the desired height for the claw to reach up, while still maintaining it's balance
            and functioning efficiently.
            Then we paused the action, so another action could follow within the code.
            Oue LED's being displayed on our microbit were designed to clearly follow the action in which our code
            inputted, so we could see posibble errors.</p>

          <span class="tag is-danger">Go Left</span>
          <img src="Go Left Code Updated.png">
          <p>To create our code to get our claw to go left, we had to code our second motor, which was connected to the
            rotating part of the claw. This part of the claw controlled the movements from left to
            right. The speed of the second motor (M2) was set to 20, after some experimentation.
            We started off with our claw set at 100, and each time we moved the claw, the claw was thrown
            off it's balance and dramatically tipping over repetitively. Once this was set to 20, we discovered we must
            pause it, then set the speed to zero. Then we cleared the screen. Once again we used the microbit LED system to
            keep track of the motions of our claw and code. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="inside">
          <span class="tag is-danger">Go Right</span>
          <img src="Go Right Code Updated.png">
          <p>To create our code to get our claw to go right, we had to set our bottom rotation motor, the second motor,
            to have a speed opposite to the left one. Since the speed of M2 was 20 for the claw to spin the direction
            left, we knew we must have the speed at -20 for the claw to spin in the opposite direction. Once again with this one,
            we started at the speed 100, which caused various issues within the movement of our claw.
            Once we had coded for this, we got our claw to pause for 1000ms and set the speed to zero, so it wouldn't
            continue to rotate more. We once again used LED's to display the desired action of the code in case of
            errors.</p>

        <span class="tag is-danger">Grab</span>
        <img src="Grab Code Updated.png">
        <p>Our Grab and Release code required us to use another motor whilst coding to control and move the mouth of the
          claw. This motor was at the top of the claw and was connected to the rotating gears which opened and closed
          the claw. To code this, we set the motor (M1) to a speed of 20. This speed was decided after seeing how the different 
          speeds controlled how opened the claw would become. On top of that, we added a
          1000ms pause to the code and set the speed to zero, so that the motor would fully stop its action. We once
          again used the LED system for clarity when issues arised.</p>

      <hr>
      <div class ="inside">
        <span class="tag is-danger">Release</span>
        <img src="Release Code Updated.png">
        <p>To create our code for our claw to release, we knew we just had to do the opposite to the grab code. This
          meant we still used the M1 motor, as it still controls the same gears we need controlled for the release code.
          The speed was set to -20 as we wanted it to be the exact same speed as the grab code so it could be the exact
          same amount. This stopped the claw
          from crushing in on itself. We made the motor pause for 1000ms and then set the speed to zero once again. We
          used our LED's to show a similar image to an open claw, so we knew that it was the claw attempting to release
          when it came to errors.

        <img src="Radio controls updated.png">
        <p>As mentioned before, we had to have our code options radioed to our microbit. Our other microbit had a simple
          selection of code which sent radio signals when certain buttons were pressed which greatly helped with our
          system. We had our radio system set on start so that it was guaranteed to work immediately. We also began our
          code with setting our claw upright so that was one less thing we had to worry about.</p>

        <p>In our code, we decided we had to create manual code to reset our grab and release. This was because after
          each person used our claw, it always was still slightly opened at the end. These buttons were located on the
          sides of our claw. In between uses of our claw machine, we closed the claw until it was fully closed,
          following that we pressed our release grab button once.
          This guaranteed to fully close when people were using our machine.</p>
